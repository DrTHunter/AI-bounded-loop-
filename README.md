# AI-bounded-loop-
Bounded local LLM loop engine for Windows (Python): one scheduler + shared runtime contract with hard cutoffs, tool routing, and stable state/journaling. Supports two agent profiles (Orion + Elysia) via a router, with clean prompt separation and namespaced memory—built to add new tools/actions over time without breaking safety.
